# Project Rules for Neutral News Source App

## 1. Codebase & Structure

- Use Next.js with the App Router for all frontend and API routes.
- Organize code in the `src/app` directory following Next.js conventions.
- Use TypeScript for all code (frontend, backend, utilities).
- All components must be functional components using React hooks.

## 2. Collaboration & Workflow

- All code changes must be made via pull requests and reviewed by at least one other team member.
- Use clear, descriptive commit messages and PR titles.
- Assign PRs to relevant team members based on the area of responsibility (see below).

## 3. Team Responsibilities

- **Website (Next.js):** Pete Allport, Jishnu Anandh, Aishwarya Raja
- **Deployment (Cloudflare/Vercel):** Pete Allport, Aishwarya Raja
- **Inference (FriendliAI/OpenAI):** Jishnu Anandh
- **Weaviate RAG Integration:** Timothy Tan, Jishn Anandh

## 4. AI & Data

- Use FriendliAI for inference by default; fallback to OpenAI if needed.
- Integrate Weaviate for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with news articles.
- Ensure all AI integrations are modular and can be swapped/configured via environment variables.

## 5. News Sources & Neutrality

- Aggregate news from both left-leaning and right-leaning sources.
- Implement logic to present a balanced, neutral summary for each news topic.
- Clearly document the sources and methodology for neutrality in the README.

## 6. Deployment

- Deploy the app to Vercel, with automated deployments from the main branch.
- Store all secrets and API keys in environment variables, never in the codebase.

## 7. Testing & Quality

- Write unit and integration tests for all critical logic, especially AI and aggregation logic.
- Use ESLint and Prettier for code quality and formatting.
- All code must pass linting and tests before merging.

## 8. Documentation

- Keep the README up to date with setup, deployment, and contribution instructions.
- Document all major architectural decisions and third-party integrations.
